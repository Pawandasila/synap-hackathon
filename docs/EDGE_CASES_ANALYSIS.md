// Critical Edge Cases Fixes Documentation

## Edge Cases Found and Fixed:

### 1. **Event Deletion Cascade Issue** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: When an event is deleted (soft delete), related enrollments were not handled
**Fix**: Added automatic cancellation of all enrollments when event is deleted

### 2. **User Profile Update** ‚úÖ VERIFIED
**Status**: Already implemented properly with:
- Self-update authorization
- Email uniqueness validation  
- Password hashing
- Dynamic field updates

### 3. **Team-Enrollment Synchronization** ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem**: Team operations weren't updating enrollment records
**Fix**: Added enrollment updates to:
- createTeam
- joinTeam  
- leaveTeam
- removeMember
- deleteTeam

### 4. **Race Conditions in Team Operations** ‚ö†Ô∏è POTENTIAL ISSUE
**Issue**: Multiple users joining the same team simultaneously could exceed team size limits
**Recommendation**: Add database-level constraints or implement transactions

### 5. **Soft Delete Consistency** ‚úÖ VERIFIED
**Status**: Events use soft delete (IsActive = 0), preserving data integrity

## Additional Recommendations:

### A. **Add Database Constraints**
```sql
-- Add check constraint for team size
ALTER TABLE team_members 
ADD CONSTRAINT CHK_TeamSize CHECK (
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM team_members WHERE TeamId = TeamId) <= 
    (SELECT MaxTeamSize FROM events e INNER JOIN teams t ON e.EventID = t.EventId WHERE t.TeamId = TeamId)
);
```

### B. **Add Transaction Wrapper Utility**
```javascript
export const executeInTransaction = async (operations) => {
    const pool = await poolPromise;
    const transaction = new sql.Transaction(pool);
    
    try {
        await transaction.begin();
        
        for (const operation of operations) {
            await operation(transaction);
        }
        
        await transaction.commit();
    } catch (error) {
        await transaction.rollback();
        throw error;
    }
};
```

### C. **Add Input Sanitization**
- Team names should be sanitized for XSS
- Event descriptions should be sanitized
- Search terms should be escaped

### D. **Add Rate Limiting**
- Login attempts
- Team creation
- Event enrollment

### E. **Add Audit Logging**
- User actions tracking
- Team membership changes
- Event modifications

## Critical Security Checks:

### ‚úÖ **Already Implemented:**
1. Parameterized queries (SQL injection prevention)
2. Password hashing
3. JWT authentication
4. Role-based authorization
5. User ownership validation
6. Input validation with Zod

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Still Needed:**
1. Rate limiting
2. Input sanitization for XSS
3. Audit logging
4. Transaction support for critical operations
5. Database-level constraints

## Status Summary:
- **High Priority Issues**: ‚úÖ All Fixed
- **Medium Priority**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Transaction support recommended
- **Low Priority**: üìù Audit logging and rate limiting for production
